CS 344 - Project 3

Name: Zach Colbert

Makefile provided for compilation. Just run `make` in the top directory.
Then, run executable `smallsh`

Signals are not handled according to spec. I didn't have time to complete this.
Backgrounding is partially implemented, but is broken. Child processes are
inconsistently cleaned up.
