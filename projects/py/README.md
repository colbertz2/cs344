# Python Project

## Requirements
1. Program is contained in 1 file, `mypython.py`
2. On execution, create 3 files in the same directory as the script.
    a. File names must be unique (but not random)
    b. Files must contain exactly 10 random characters (lowercase alpha only), with no spaces
    c. 11th character of file must be newline
    d. Additional executions do not append to files
    e. Files should remain in directory after execution (no cleanup)
3. On execution, output contents of each file to stdout (one per line)
4. After file contents have been printed, print two random ints (1 to 42, inclusive) each on a separate line.
5. Finally, print the product of the two ints.

## Notes
+ `sys.stdout.write()` ?
